<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>
JavaScript debugger for Eclipse, which supports debugging of Compile-to-JavaScript languages that generate 
<a target="blank" href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">Source Maps</a>.
</p>
<p>
Currently, it has built-in support for <a target="blank" href="http://gwtproject.org">GWT</a>, 
but it should be easy to add support for any other compile-to-JavaScript language like
<a target="blank" href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, 
<a target="blank" href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, 
<a target="blank" href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/">Kotlin</a>, etc.
</p> 
<p>
It has been adapted from the <a target="blank" href="http://dartlang.org">Dart</a> project, and modified for use as a generic JavaScript debugger.
</p>

<h3>How to install?</h3>
<p>			
Eclipse 3.7 or later is required.
</p>

Install from the SDBG P2 repository by using the following sequence of Eclipse commands:
<ul> 
<li>Help menu -> Install New Software... -> Add...
<li>(The "Add Repository" dialog will appear)
<li>For "Name", enter "SDBG" or something similar
<li>For "Location", fill-in the following URL: <a target="blank" href="http://sdbg.github.io/p2">http://sdbg.github.io/p2</a>
</ul>
Alternatively, you can download the latest <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/sdbg/sdbg/releases">SDBG P2 repository ZIP</a> 
and install it by using the following sequence of Eclipse commands:
<ul>
<li>Help menu -> Install New Software... -> Add... -> Archive...
</ul>

<h3>Community</h3>
Any comments, bugs or issues should be directed to the <a target="blank" href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/sdbg">SDBG Google Group</a>.

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
The current implementation can be considered beta quality.
</p>
<b>What is working:</b>		
<ul>
<li> Launching a new instance of Chrome for debugging
<li> Connecting to a running Chrome instance for debugging
<li> Debugging code running in the Chrome for Mobile browser on Android 
(including port forwarding a website running locally on your PC to Chrome for Mobile!)
<li> Setting breakpoints in Java, including setting breakpoint in code coming from JAR libraries
<li> Opening the Java (or other source language) source files instead of the obfuscated JavaScript
</ul>
<b>What is mostly working:</b>
<ul>
<li> Deobfuscating the stacktrace. Works but does not look 100% like e.g. the JDT Debugger stacktrace. 
For example, the methods are not deobfuscated to their Java equivalents
</ul>
<b>Future work:</b>
<ul>
<li> Prio A: <b>Deobfuscating the Variable tabs.</b> Currently, Eclipse will display the Variables tab with your JavaScript objects in them (not yet translated back to Java)
<li> Prio A-B: Support for other source languages besides Java (e.g. CoffeeScript, TypeScript etc.); should require relatively little effort, as the interfaces for implementing such support are now well defined
<li> Prio A-B: Support for Safari, Opera and Mobile Safari; should be easy as all these currently use the same Remote Debugging protocol as Chrome
<li> Prio B: Support for Internet Explorer and Firefox
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
Once you are running the plugin, you can test it using the gwtproject.zip file found in the root of the repository:
<ul> 
<li>Import the project into your Eclipse workspace by using the following commands: File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Next -> Select Archive file
<li>Next, open the "Debug Configurations" dialog and invoke the "gwtproject" launch configuration which will be available under "Chrome launch" in the launchers' tree
<li>Put a breakpoint in the method called "toggleMenu", in the (only) Java file in the gwtproject project - GWTProjectEntryPoint.java  
<li>Click on "Articles" or "Documentation" in the "Table of contents" tree at the <a target="blank" href="http://gwtproject.org">GWT Project Page</a>
<li>Observe the breakpoint being hit
</ul>

<h3>Build Instructions</h3>

<b>To clone the Git repository</b> (forgive the large download; we have retained all Dart history for now):
<pre>git clone git@github.com:sdbg/sdbg.git</pre>

<b>To develop in Eclipse:</b>
<ul>
<li>Import the root of the source as a <a target="blank" href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> project  
<li>Inside the <b>com.github.sdbg.debug.ui</b> project, you will see a launch configuration called <b>SDBG.launch</b>
<li>Running this configuration will open a new instance of Eclipse with the debugger plugin installed
</ul>

<b>To build everything from the command-line, including the P2 repository:</b>
<pre>mvn install</pre>
